        * Advisor: Bhaskar Krishnamachari
        * Adopted deep Q-learning to train an agent to learn the most efficient and precise policy network for active information gathering in HRI

  - title: Research Fellow

        * Advisor: John M. Dolan
        * Devised a theoretic framework that empowers autonomous agent to probe a human agent to clarify its belief on humanâ€™s underlying model by optimizing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence on its belief
        * Identified two use cases in autonomous driving where autonmous vehicle leverages the probed information to influence human vehicles to create better participant experience and system efficiency
        * Submitted paper to 2023 IEEE ICRA (Preprint, Research Poster)

        * Advisor: Bhaskar Krishnamachari
        * Devised a polynomial-time DP-based algorithm that solves the optimal trading policy under dynamic AMMs that performs drastically better than baseline algorithms like the exhaustive search or the Lagrange multiplier
        * Presented the paper at 2022 IEEE ICBC and answered questions from peers (Conference Paper, Presentation Video)
