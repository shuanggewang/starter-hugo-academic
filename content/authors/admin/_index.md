I'm a senior at University of Southern California, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Applied and Computational Mathematics. During my undergrad, I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Bhaskar Krishnamachari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JHJozAYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from the [Autonomous Networks Research Group](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/), working on dynamic optimizaiton in algorithmic economics and deep reinforcement learning in HRI. I was also fortunate to work as a research fellow under the advisement of Prof. [John M. Dolan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xLk_w7kAAAAJ&hl=en) from [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on active information gathering and influence in HRI with specific applications in the domain of autonomous driving. Currently, my undergraduate honors thesis centers around using deep reinforcement learning techniques in active information gathering in game-theoretical HRI.
